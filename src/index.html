    <h2>CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

    <p><b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
        the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
        conversations in it, <mark>“and what is the use of a book,”</mark> thought Alice
        <strong>“without pictures or conversations?”</strong></p>

    <p><u>So she was considering</u> in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her <s>feel very sleepy and stupid</s>), whether the pleasure of
        making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
        picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        close by her.</p>

    <p>There was nothing <span>so very</span> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
        so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
        dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
        it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
        time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a
            watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried
        on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
        had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
        watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
        field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
        large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
